# Slave-3-LVDT

## Disclaimer Note

The current prototype used in the system are centrally based on off-the-shelf available components. The programming environment in such boards are supported by Python and C++.
The development team understands that industry standard microcontrollers widely provide support for C language. Keeping this in mind, we
intend to send and process binary executables directly via LoRaWAN and not individually program each subsystem. This is will enable cross-platform development.
